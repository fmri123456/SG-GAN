This code is the implementation of FIAD-GAN.

FIAD: feature information aggregation and diffusion genera-tion adversarial network for disease classification and feature extraction.

The experiment data can be downloaded in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets. During the experiment, the order of code use is the same as the label.
