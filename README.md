# This code is the implementation of SG-GAN.

# SG-GAN: structural gathering generation adversarial network for disease classification and feature extraction.

# The experiment data can be downloaded in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets. During the experiment, the order of code use is the same as the label.
